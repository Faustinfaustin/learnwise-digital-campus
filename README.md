## Our Story
Founded in 2018 by a team of industry experts and educators, LearnWise was born from a simple observation: traditional education wasn't keeping pace with rapidly evolving tech fields.

We started with a single cybersecurity course and a vision to create practical, industry-relevant training that would prepare students for real-world challenges. Today, we've expanded to cover the most in-demand tech skills with over 100 courses and a global community of more than 500,000 learners.

Our commitment remains the same: to provide accessible, high-quality education that bridges the gap between academic learning and industry needs, empowering students to thrive in their tech careers.
